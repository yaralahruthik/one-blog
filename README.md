# one-blog

Just building something for fun!

## New Thoughts

- Need a minimal interface to help me improve writing.
- Markdown First -> Solving my need first.
- Focus Mode -> Focus on current sentence and dim the rest.
- Syntax Highlighting -> Help me identify the clutter in my writing.

The MVP would be the above features with markdown export.

## Inspiration

> The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love.
