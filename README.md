Just building something for fun!

## New Thoughts

- Need a minimal interface to help me improve writing.
- Markdown First -> Solving my need first.
- Focus Mode -> Focus on current sentence and dim the rest.
- Syntax Highlighting -> Help me identify the clutter in my writing.

The MVP would be the above features with markdown export.

## Inspiration

> The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there's a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love.

- [Daylight](https://daylightcomputer.com/): The early inspiration comes from Daylight's distraction free writing mode. I never tried it but looked amazing.
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer): First heard of this from my initial conversation with ChatGPT, then a few more folks from the [Frontend Hire](https://frontendhire.com/) community and reddit suggested this tool. My problem is that it is not web-based.
- [Typora](https://typora.io/): Checked for the alternatives of `iA Writer` and found this. Again, not web-based. But is a more WYSIWYG than `iA Writer`.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): I like this tool but never used it as much as I wanted.

The product I want to build:

- Has iA Writer's minimal interface
- Has Typora style WYSIWYG
- Helps build a note taking system like Obsidian
- Exports directly to markdown with YAML data

I am still experimenting and thoughts could change as I build.
